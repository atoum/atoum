* Why some classes has name *\phpClass instead of *\class?
The word "class" is reserved by PHP, so it's not possible to use this name for a class.
In this case, the atoum convention is to prefix name with word "php".

It's a work in progress and you're welcome to improve it.
Moreover, atoum's unit test is the documentation.

* Why I get a fail message when testing a class that uses APC?
APC is "a free, open, and robust framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code" (http://php.net/apc.configuration) distributed under the form of a PHP extension.
When testing classes that use APC, you may get some failure messages showing that apc_fetch is unable to retrieve a value.
As all PHP extension, APC has some configuration options to enable it:
  - apc.enabled: whether to enable or disable APC,
  - apc.enable_cli: whether to enable or disable APC for PHP CLI.
Setting apc.enabled to 1 in your CLI configuration does not do the trick: to avoid these failure messages, you have to set the apc.enable_cli option to 1, otherwise, the extension won't be enabled for the PHP CLI version, which is used by atoum.
