The word "class" is reserved by PHP, so it's not possible to use this name for a class.

* Why I get a fail message when testing a class that uses APC ?
APC is "a free, open, and robust framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code" (http://fr.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php) distributed under the form of a PHP extension.
When testing classes that use APC, you may get some failure message showing that apc_fetch is unable to retrieve a value.
As all PHP extension, APC has some configuration options to enable it :
  - apc.enabled : Whether to enable or disable APC
  - apc.enable_cli : Whether to enable or disable APC for PHP CLI
Setting apc.enabled to 1 in your CLI configuration does not do the trick : to avoid these failure message, you have to set the apc.enable_cli option to 1, otherwise, the extension won't be enabled for the PHP CLI version, which is used by atoum.
